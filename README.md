# B-Series-Samsung-tv-Best-white-balance-Gamma-settings

 Welcome For this tutorial Heres what we are going to do:

 Find Where is White balance is at

 Change it for the best Blacks

Etc....




Now First go to service menu pressing these keys:Info + Menu + Mute + Power (U Might need to press Mute 1 + 8 + 2 depending on the region and the model)

Btw, I Have tried this on a b550 So be careful

After entering service menu go to ABC/WB
Select White balance

Now heres the settings:
Sub brightness:50
R Offset:505
G Offset:510
B Offset:515
Sub Contrast:150
R Gain:520

G Gain:500
B Gain:550

[This Was Created For The best Blacks and mid whites]

Now Go to Control --> Sub Options --> Gamma
Set it to 08.5 or 08.8 (0.88 Recomended)
Restart Ur Tv
Done! 



[DONT CHANGE SETTINGS THAT U DONT KNOW BECAUSE THEY HAVE A CHANCE TO KILL UR DEVICE INSTANTLY AFTER U RESTART!]
